## A game of Checks.
Checkers is a two-player board game played on a checkered board. Each player has twelve pieces, and the goal is to capture all of the opponent's pieces or block them from moving. Players move pieces diagonally and can capture an opponent's piece by jumping over it diagonally. The game ends when one player captures all of the opponent's pieces or when the opponent cannot make any more moves.
